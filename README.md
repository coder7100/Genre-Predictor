# Genre-Predictor
This module Will detect the suitable genre for a person depending on their age and their gender using machine learning .
it is devloped in jupyter environment . 
for this we have used scikit library for both training the machine as well as for predicting the results.
for training purpose i have included a database of 21 records having the users age and gender and which genre they prefer.
Also the machine is trained only once and we are using that trained machine for predictions rather than training it everytime. this helps in achieving results quickly and Efficiently .
This project is based on the Machine learning module taught by Mosh Hamedani in his Python course
